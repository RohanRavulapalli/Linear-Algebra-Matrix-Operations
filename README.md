# Linear-Algebra-Matrix-Operations
This repository contains the documentation, code and file for my linear algebra matrix operations calculator project.
My calculator provides various operations for matrices, including conversion to echelon form, calculating the determinant, calculating the inverse of a given matrix,
and others. This calculator does NOT use built-in libraries such as NumPy or SciPy. Rather, all the operations were coded from scratch. The goal of this project was to
showcase proficiency in linear algebra, construction of algorithms, as well as provide a more visual and descriptive outline of how these mathematical operations can be programmed
using popular languages such as python (When we use libraries such as NumPy or SciPy to calculate the echelon form of a matrix, all the work is under the hood and hidden, which can
leave those without full knowledge of these operations clueless as to how they are calculated).
