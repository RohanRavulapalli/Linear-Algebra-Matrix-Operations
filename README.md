# Linear Algebra Matrix Operations (Personal Learning Project)
This repository contains the documentation, code and file for my linear algebra matrix operations calculator project.
My calculator provides various operations for matrices, including conversion to echelon form, calculating the determinant, calculating the inverse of a given matrix,
and other operations. This calculator does NOT make use of external libraries such as NumPy or SciPy to perform matrix operations. Rather, all the operations were coded from scratch. The goal of this project was to
showcase proficiency in linear algebra, construction of algorithms, as well as provide a more visual and descriptive outline as to how these mathematical matrix operations can be programmed
using popular languages such as python, as when we use third party libraries such as NumPy or SciPy to perform matrix operations, all of the work is under the hood and hidden from the programmer, which can
leave those without essential understanding of these operations and algorithms clueless as to how they are actually calculated and why they work.
